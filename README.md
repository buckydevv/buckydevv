# 👋 Hey, I'm Bucky

I'm a developer from **Scotland** 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 
I build things I think are cool, usually with Python and Discord bots.  
I'm also a **songwriter** — music and code are both ways I like to tell stories!

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

### 🌍 [World](https://github.com/buckydevv/World)
A Discord bot focused on being fast, clean, and actually useful in so many ways.  
I'm building it to be simple to use, easy to manage, and super fun to interact with that much you would get addicted.

### 🎮 [Rari](https://github.com/rayovanii/rari)
Something a bit more experimental.
helping a user out with their bot! :D

## 💬 A Bit More About Me

- I’m from **Scotland**, and yes, I do like Irn-Bru.
- I’ve been making bots and projects for a while — mostly for fun.
- When I’m not coding, I’m probably writing lyrics, producing music, or messing with something creative.

Thanks for stopping by :)
